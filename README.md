# My Time
An music album, wich can be listened on every single existing plateform!

Oh, hello there! Looks like you found my project!

My time is a group of albums that are made to be listened on almost every plateforms, all you need is an computer or a phone to transfer it.
So far theres **1 Album** wich makes a total of **19 Songs**, but i'll add more when i'll have time to.

So? Where do we start?
(To access the releases edit the link and add /releases at the end)

## Using a mp3 reader
### Android, Windows, Linux, MacOS

1- Download the .zip from the releases.
2- Extract it and copy it where you want.
3- (LINUX ONLY) If you are using a pure made distro, you'll need a reader like RyhtmBox.
4- Select one of the song to start listening!

## Using iTunes
### iOS, iPadOS, iPod, MacOS, YOU NEED A WORKING COMPUTER/iMAC !
(You can try to use GtkPOD with linux but... yea.)
1- Download the .zip from the releases.
2- Extract it where you want. (Ex: Music folder)
3- Open iTunes, or install it from MSstore if you don't have it, and go to the "Library Tab"
4- Open the directory where you extracted the whole thing and press CRTL+A to select everything. (On mac its CMD+A... I think)
5- Drag and drop the files to iTunes.
6- Plug your iDevice,
7- Drag and drop once again but this time in the "My iPhone/iPod/iPad" tab.
8- (iPhone and iPad only) Open the iTunes app, and select "Library"
9- Enjoy your music!

## Using an SD CARD
### Nintendo 3ds, Wii, WIIU...
You need a jailbreak to do this, pal. (Check CFW guide online!)

1- Download the .zip from the releases.
2- Extract it where you want. (Ex: Music folder)
3- Copy them to the SD CARD at the spot that you want.

Now, the quirky part.

**For 3DS:** You'll need an mp3 player such as Ctrmus 3DS. You can install it with the Universal updater. Once its done, open the repertory and select a song.
**For WIIU:**  You'll need to have the HOMEBREW CHANNEL INSTALLED in the virtual WII. Once its done follow the "WII" Instructions.
**For WII:** Install WiiMC, and, since its kinda easy to use, click the SD card tab and play some music!

## How to collaborate?
You can send me a DM on X To recommend songs for the Vol 1.1! I'd love to see what music you guys are listening to ;)
